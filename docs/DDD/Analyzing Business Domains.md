# Analyzing Business Domains

## What Is a Business Domain?

A business domain defines a company’s main area of activity. Generally speaking,  
it’s the service the company provides to its clients. For example:

- FedEx provides courier delivery
- Starbucks is best known for its coffee
- Walmart is one of the most widely recognized retail establishments

A company can operate in multiple business domains. For example:

- Amazon provides both retail and cloud computing services
- Uber is a ride share company that also provides food delivery and bicycle-sharing services

:::tip Note

It’s important to note that companies may change their business domains often. A
canonical example of this is Nokia, which over the years has operated in fields as
diverse as wood processing, rubber manufacturing, telecommunications, and mobile
communications.

## What Is a Subdomain?

A subdomain is a fine-grained area of business activity.  
All of a company’s subdomains form its business domain: the service it provides to its customers.

Implementing a single subdomain is not enough for a company to succeed.  
A company has to operate in multiple subdomains,  
and the subdomains have to interact with each other to achieve the company’s goals and targets in the business domain.

For example:  
Starbucks may be most recognized for its coffee,  
but building a successful coffeehouse chain requires more than just knowing how to make great coffee.  
You also have to buy or rent real estate at effective locations, hire personnel, and manage finances, among other activities.

None of these subdomains on its own will make a profitable company.  
All of them together are necessary for a company to be able to compete in its business domain(s).

## Types of Subdomains

Domain-driven design distinguishes between three types of subdomains:

- ### Core Subdomains

  A core subdomain is what a company does differently from its competitors.  
  This may involve inventing new products or services or reducing costs by optimizing existing processes.

- ### Generic Subdomains

  Generic subdomains are business activities that all companies are performing in the same way.  
  Like core subdomains, generic subdomains are generally complex and hard to implement.  
  However, generic subdomains do not provide any competitive edge for the company.  
  There is no need for innovation or optimization here:  
  battle tested implementations are widely available, and all companies use them.

- ### Supporting Subdomains

  As the name suggests, supporting subdomains support the company’s business.  
  However, contrary to core subdomains, supporting subdomains do not provide any competitive advantage.
