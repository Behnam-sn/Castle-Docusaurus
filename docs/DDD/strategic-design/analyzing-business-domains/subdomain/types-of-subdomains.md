# Types of Subdomains

Domain-driven design distinguishes between three types of subdomains:

- ## Core Subdomains

  A core subdomain is what a company does differently from its competitors.  
  This may involve inventing new products or services or reducing costs by optimizing existing processes.

- ## Generic Subdomains

  Generic subdomains are business activities that all companies are performing in the same way.  
  Like core subdomains, generic subdomains are generally complex and hard to implement.  
  However, generic subdomains do not provide any competitive edge for the company.  
  There is no need for innovation or optimization here:  
  battle tested implementations are widely available, and all companies use them.

- ## Supporting Subdomains

  As the name suggests, supporting subdomains support the companyâ€™s business.  
  However, contrary to core subdomains, supporting subdomains do not provide any competitive advantage.
