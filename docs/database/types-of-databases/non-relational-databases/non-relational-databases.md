# Non-Relational Databases

## Introduction

NoSQL is an umbrella term for any alternative system to traditional SQL databases.
Sometimes, when we say NoSQL management systems,
we mean any database that doesn't use a relational model.

NoSQL databases use a data model that has a
different structure than the rows and columns table structure used with RDBMS.

## Types of NoSQL databases

    • Document databases

    • Key-Value stores

    • Column-Oriented databases

    • Graph databases
