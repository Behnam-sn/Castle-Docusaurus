# Document Databases

## Document databases

A document database stores data in JSON, BSON, or XML documents.
Documents in the database can be nested.
Particular elements can be indexed for faster querying.

You can access, store, and retrieve documents
from your network in a form that is much closer to the data objects used in applications,
which means less translation is required to use and access the data in an application.

Note: SQL data must often be assembled and disassembled
when moving between applications, storage, or more than one network.

Document databases are popular with developers,
because they offer the flexibility
to rework their document structures as needed to suit their applications.

Note: The flexibility of this database speeds the development.

Data becomes like code and is under the control of developers.
They can more easily access and use it.
In SQL databases,
intervention by database administrators may be required to change the structure of a database.

Document databases are usually implemented with a scale-out architecture,
providing a path to the scalability of data volumes and traffic.

Use cases include eCommerce platforms, trading platforms, and mobile app development.

Some document databases Implementations:

- MongoDB
- Cosmos DB
- Elasticsearch

Comparing MongoDB vs. PostgreSQL offers an analysis of MongoDB, the leading distributed NoSQL database, and PostgreSQL (an open source DBMS).
