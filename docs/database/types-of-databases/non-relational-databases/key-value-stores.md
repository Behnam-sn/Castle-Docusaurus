# Key-Value Stores

## Introduction

This is the simplest type of NoSQL database.
Every element is stored as a key-value pair consisting of an attribute name ("key") and a value.

This database is like an RDBMS with two columns:
the attribute name (such as "state") and the value (such as "Alaska").

Use cases for NoSQL databases include shopping carts, user preferences, and user profiles.
