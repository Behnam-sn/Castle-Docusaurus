# Graph Databases

A graph database focuses on the relationship between data elements.
Each element is contained as a node.
The connections between elements in the database are called links or relationships.
Connections are first-class elements of the database, stored directly.

A graph database is optimized to capture and search the connections between elements,
overcoming the overhead associated with joining several tables in SQL.
Very few real-world business systems can survive solely on graph databases.
As a result, graph databases are usually run alongside more traditional databases.

Use cases include fraud detection and social networks.
