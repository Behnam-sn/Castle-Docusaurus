# OLAP

## What is OLAP?

OLAP stands for **Online Analytical Processing**.

It is a broad term that can be looked at from two perspectives:  
Technical and business.

At the highest level,  
You can just read these words backward:

- **Processing** some source data is processed,
- **Analytical** to produce some analytical reports and insights,
- **Online** in real-time.

## OLAP from the business perspective

In recent years business people started to realize the value of data.  
Companies who make their decisions blindly more often than not fail to keep up with the competition.

The data-driven approach of successful companies forces them to collect all data that might be even remotely useful for making business decisions, and imposes on them a need for mechanisms which allow them to analyze this data in a timely manner.

Here's where OLAP database management systems (DBMS) come in.

In a business sense, OLAP allows companies to continuously plan, analyze, and report operational activities, thus maximizing efficiency, reducing expenses, and ultimately conquering the market share. It could be done either in an in-house system or outsourced to SaaS providers like web/mobile analytics services, CRM services, etc. OLAP is the technology behind many BI applications (Business Intelligence).

ClickHouse is an OLAP database management system that is pretty often used as a backend for those SaaS solutions for analyzing domain-specific data. However, some businesses are still reluctant to share their data with third-party providers and so an in-house data warehouse scenario is also viable.
