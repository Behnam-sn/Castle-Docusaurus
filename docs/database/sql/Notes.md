# Notes

Most of this book is concerned with the data portion of the SQL language,  
Which consists of the `select`, `update`, `insert`, and `delete` commands.

In general, SQL schema statements do not require much discussion apart from their syntax,  
Whereas SQL data statements,  
While few in number,  
Offer numerous opportunities for detailed study.

Therefore, while I try to introduce you to many of the SQL schema statements,  
Most chapters in this book concentrate on the SQL data statements.
