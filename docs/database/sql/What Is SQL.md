# What Is SQL?

Along with Codd’s definition of the relational model,  
He proposed a language called DSL/Alpha for manipulating the data in relational tables.

Shortly after Codd’s paper was released,  
IBM commissioned a group to build a prototype based on Codd’s ideas.

This group created a simplified version of DSL/Alpha that they called SQUARE.

Refinements to SQUARE led to a language called SEQUEL,  
Which was finally shortened to SQL.

While SQL began as a language used to manipulate data in relational databases,  
It has evolved to be a language for manipulating data across various database technologies.

SQL is now more than 40 years old,  
And it has undergone a great deal of change along the way.

In the mid-1980s,  
The American National Standards Institute (ANSI),  
Began working on the first standard for the SQL language,  
Which was published in 1986.

Subsequent refinements led to new releases of the SQL standard in 1989, 1992, 1999, 2003, 2006, 2008, 2011, and 2016.

Along with refinements to the core language,  
New features have been added to the SQL language,  
To incorporate object-oriented functionality, among other things.

The later standards focus on the integration of related technologies,  
Such as extensible markup language (XML) and JavaScript object notation (JSON).

SQL goes hand in hand with the relational model,  
Because the result of an SQL query is a table (also called, in this context, a result set).

Thus, a new permanent table can be created in a relational database,  
Simply by storing the result set of a query.

Similarly, a query can use both permanent tables and the result sets from other queries as inputs.

One final note:  
SQL is not an acronym for anything.  
Although many people will insist it stands for “Structured Query Language”.

When referring to the language,  
It is equally acceptable to say the letters individually (i.e., S. Q. L.) or to use the word _sequel_.
