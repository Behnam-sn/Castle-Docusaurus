## What is a Database?

## What is a DBMS?

A database management system is a software to store, organize, manage, and retrieve data.

## What Type of Information is Stored in a Database?

A database is a software component thatâ€™s critical in almost every modern application,  
whether the database is on your personal phone, computer, or the internet.

An operational database system will store much of the data an application needs to function,  
keeping the data organized and allowing users to access the data.

If you were building an eCommerce app,  
some of the data you might access and store in your operational database system includes:

- Customer data, like usernames, email addresses, and preferences.

- Business data, like product colors, prices, and ratings.

- Relationship data, like the locations of stores with a specific product in stock.

Why We Need Database?

Many databases start as a list in a word-processing program or spreadsheet.
As the list grows bigger:

- Redundancies and inconsistencies begin to appear in the data.
- The data becomes hard to understand in list form,
- Lack of security,
- and there are limited ways of searching or pulling subsets of data out for review.

Once these problems start to appear,
it's a good idea to transfer the data to a database created by a database management system (DBMS).

Together, the data and the DBMS,
along with the applications that are associated with them,
are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.

Databases are an essential part of modern life.
Without them, most computer functions would cease to exist.

If you're someone that relies on storing information within a computer,
whether as an individual or for your job,
it's important to understand the different types of databases that exist and how you should use them.
