# UML as Sketch

By far the most common of the 3 is UML as sketch.

The essence of sketching is selectivity.  
In this usage, developers use the UML to help communicate some aspects of a system.

you can use sketches in a forward-engineering or reverse-engineering direction.

With forward sketching,  
You rough out some issues in code you are about to write,  
Usually discussing them with a group of people an your team.

Your aim is to use the sketches to help communicate ideas and alternatives about what you're about to do.

You don't talk about all the code you are going to work on,  
Only important issues that you want to run past your colleagues first,  
Or sections of the design that you want to visualize before you begin programming.

Sessions like this can be very short,  
A 10-minute session to discuss a few hours of programming or a day to discuss a 2-week iteration.

With reverse engineering,  
You use sketches to explain how some part of a system works.

You don't show every class,  
Simply those that are interesting and worth talking about before you dig into the code.

Because sketching is pretty informal and dynamic,  
You need to do it quickly and collaboratively,  
So a common medium is a whiteboard.

Sketches are also useful in documents,  
In which case the focus is communication rather than completeness.

The tools used for sketching are lightweight drawing tools,  
And often people aren't too particular about keeping to every strict rule of the UML.
