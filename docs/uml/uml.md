# UML

## What is the UML?

The **Unified Modeling Language (UML)** is a family of graphical notations.  
UML is backed by single meta-model, that help in describing and designing software systems.  
Particularly software systems built using the object-oriented (OO) style.

That's a somewhat simplified definition.  
In fact, the UML is a few different things to different people.  
This comes both from its own history,  
And from the different views that people have about what makes an effective software engineering process.

## Why Bother with the UML?

Graphical modeling languages have been around in the software industry for a long time.

The fundamental driver behind them all is that,  
Programming languages are not at a high enough level of abstraction to facilitate discussions about design.

Graphical design notations primary value is in communication and understanding.

A good diagram can often help communicate ideas about a design.  
Particularly when you want to avoid a lot of details.

Diagrams can also help you understand either a software system or a business process.

As part of a team trying to figure out something,  
Diagrams both help understanding and communicate that understanding throughout a team.

The UML's importance comes from its wide use and standardization within the OO development community.  
The UML has become not only the dominant graphical notation within the OO world,  
But also a popular technique in non-OO circles.

## What is the History of The UML?

The UML was born out of the unification of the many object-oriented graphical modeling languages,  
That thrived in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  
Since its appearance in 1997,  
It has relegated that particular tower of Babel to history.

The UML is a relatively open standard, controlled by the Object Management Group (OMG), an open consortium of companies.

The OMG was formed to build standards that supported interoperability,  
Specifically the interoperability of object-oriented systems.

<!-- ## What is New UML 2?

UML 2 has added a lot of new stuff,
Including several new diagram types.

Even familiar diagrams have a lot of new notation,
Such as interaction frames in sequence diagrams -->

## Ways of Using UML

The role of the UML in software development depends on the different ways people want to use it.

Despite the fact that graphical modeling languages have been around for a long time,  
There is an enormous amount of dispute in the software industry about their role.

These disputes play directly into how people perceive the role of the UML itself and how the UML should be used.

To untangle this Steve Mellor and Martin Fowler independently came up with a characterization of the three modes in which people use the UML:

- Sketch
- Blueprint
- Programming Language

## UML Diagrams

UML 2 describes 13 official diagram types.

These diagram types are the way many people approach the UML,
But the UML's authors do not see diagrams as the central part of the UML.

As a result, the diagram types are not particularly rigid.  
Often, you can legally use elements from one diagram type an another diagram.

The UML standard indicates that certain elements are typically drawn an certain diagram types, but this is not a prescription.
