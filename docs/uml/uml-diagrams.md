# UML Diagrams

UML 2 describes 13 official diagram types.

<!-- These diagram types are the way many people approach the UML,
But the UML's authors do not see diagrams as the central part of the UML.

As a result, the diagram types are not particularly rigid.
Often, you can legally use elements from one diagram type an another diagram.

The UML standard indicates that certain elements are typically drawn an certain diagram types, but this is not a prescription. -->
