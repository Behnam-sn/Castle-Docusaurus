# UML Diagrams

UML 2 describes 13 official diagram types
And classified as

Although these diagram types are the way many people approach the UML,  
The UML's authors do not see diagrams as the central part of the UML.

As a result, the diagram types are not particularly rigid.  
Often, you can legally use elements from one diagram type an another diagram.  
The UML standard indicates that certain elements are typically drawn an certain diagram types, but this is not a prescription.

## Types

### Activity

Procedural and parallel behavior

### Class

Class, features, and relationships

### Communication

Interaction between objects ; emphasis on links

### Component

Structure and connections of components

### Composite Structure

Runtime decomposition of a class

### Deployment

Deployment of artifacts to nodes

### Interaction Overview

Mix of sequence and activity diagram

### Object

Example configurations of instances

### Package

Compile-time hierarchic structure

### Sequence

Interaction between objects; emphasis an sequence

### State Machine

How events change an object over its life

### Timing

Interaction between objects; emphasis an timing

### Use Case

How users interact with a system

What Is Legal UML?

At first blush, this should be a simple question to answer : Legal UML is what is
defined as well formed in the specification . In practice, however, the answer is a
bit more complicated .

An important part of this question is whether the UML has descriptive or
prescriptive rules . A language with prescriptive rules is controlled by an official
body that states what is or isn't legal in the language and what meaning you
give to utterances in that language . A language with descriptive rules is one in
which you understand its rules by looking at how people use the language in
practice . Programming languages tend to have prescriptive rules set by a Stan-
dards committee or dominant vendor, while natural languages, such as English,
tend to have descriptive rules whose meaning is set by convention .

UML is quite a precise language, so you might expect it to have prescriptive
rules . But UML is often considered to be the software equivalent of the blueprints
in other engineering disciplines, and these blueprints are not prescriptive nota-
tions . No committee says what the legal symbols are an a structural engineering
drawing; the notation has been accepted by convention, similarly to a natural lan-
guage . Simply having a standards body doesn't do the trick either, because people
in the field may not follow everything the Standards body says ; just ask the
French about the Academie Fran~aise . In addition, the UML is so complex that
the Standard is often open to multiple interpretations .

If you want to understand a UML diagram, it's important to realize that
understanding the UML standard is not the whole picture . People do adopt
conventions, both in the industry widely and within a particular project . As a
result, although the UML standard can be the primary source of information an
the UML, it can't be the only one.
