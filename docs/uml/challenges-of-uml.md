# Challenges of UML

## What Is Legal UML?

At first blush, this should be a simple question to answer :  
Legal UML is what is defined as well formed in the specification.  
In practice, however, the answer is a bit more complicated.

## UML is Descriptive or Prescriptive?

An important part of this question is whether the UML has descriptive or prescriptive rules.

A language with prescriptive rules is controlled by an official body that states what is or isn't legal in the language and what meaning you give to utterances in that language.

A language with descriptive rules is one in which you understand its rules by looking at how people use the language in practice.

Programming languages tend to have prescriptive rules set by a Standards committee or dominant vendor,  
While natural languages, such as English, tend to have descriptive rules whose meaning is set by convention.

UML is quite a precise language, so you might expect it to have prescriptive rules.  
But UML is often considered to be the software equivalent of the blueprints in other engineering disciplines, and these blueprints are not prescriptive notations.

No committee says what the legal symbols are an a structural engineering drawing.  
The notation has been accepted by convention, similarly to a natural language.

Simply having a standards body doesn't do the trick either,  
Because people in the field may not follow everything the Standards body says.

In addition, the UML is so complex that the Standard is often open to multiple interpretations.

If you want to understand a UML diagram,  
It's important to realize that understanding the UML standard is not the whole picture.  
People do adopt conventions, both in the industry widely and within a particular project.

The UML standard can be the primary source of information an the UML,  
But it can't be the only one.

## The Meaning of UML

One of the awkward issues about the UML is that,  
Although the specification describes in great detail what well formed UML is,  
It doesn't have much to say about what the UML means outside of the rarefied world of the UML meta-model.

No formal definition exists of how the UML maps to any particular programming language.  
You cannot look at a UML diagram and say exactly what the equivalent code would look like.

However, you can get a rough idea of what the code would look like.  
In practice, that's enough to be useful.

Development teams often form their local conventions for these,  
And you'll need to be familiar with the ones in use.

## UML Is Not Enough

Although the UML provides quite a considerable body of various diagrams that help to define an application,  
It's by no means a complete list of all the useful diagrams that you might want to use.

In many places, different diagrams can be useful,  
And you shouldn't hesitate to use a non-UML diagram if no UML diagram suits your purpose.

You'll run into various kinds of these things in various places.  
Don't hesitate to try out techniques that seem appropriate for your project.  
If they work well, use them.  
If not, discard them.  
(This is, of course, the Same advice as for UML diagrams)

## Where to Start with the UML

Nobody, not even the creators of the UML, understand or use all of it.

Most people use a small subset of the UML and work with that.  
You have to find the subset of the UML that works for you and your colleagues.

If you are starting out,  
It's suggested that you concentrate first an the basic forms of class diagrams and sequence diagrams.  
These are the most common and, the most useful diagram types.

Once you've got the hang of those,  
You can start using some of the more advanced class diagram notation and take a look at the other diagrams types.  
Experiment with the diagrams and see how helpful they are to you.  
Don't be afraid to drop any that don't seem be useful to your work.
