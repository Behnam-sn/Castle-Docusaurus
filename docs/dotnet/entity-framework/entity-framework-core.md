# Entity Framework Core

Entity Framework (EF) Core is a lightweight, extensible, open source and cross-platform version of the popular Entity Framework data access technology.

EF Core can serve as an object-relational mapper (O/RM),  
Which enables .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects.  
And eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that typically needs to be written.

## Get Entity Framework Core

EF Core is shipped as NuGet packages.  
To add EF Core to an application, install the NuGet package for the database provider you want to use.

To install or update NuGet packages, you can use the .NET Core command-line interface (CLI), the Visual Studio Package Manager Dialog, or the Visual Studio Package Manager Console.

## Get the Entity Framework Core tools

You can install tools to carry out EF Core-related tasks in your project,  
Like creating and applying database migrations, or creating an EF Core model based on an existing database.

Two sets of tools are available:

- The .NET Core command-line interface (CLI) tools can be used on Windows, Linux, or macOS.  
  These commands begin with dotnet ef.

- The Package Manager Console (PMC) tools run in Visual Studio on Windows.  
  These commands start with a verb, for example Add-Migration, Update-Database.
