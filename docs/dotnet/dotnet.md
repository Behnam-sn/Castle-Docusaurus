# .NET

## What is .NET?

.NET is a free, cross-platform, open-source developer platform for building many kinds of applications.  
.NET is built on a high-performance runtime that is used in production by many high-scale apps.

With .NET, you can use multiple languages, editors, and libraries to build for web, mobile, desktop, games, IoT, and more.

## Why Choose .NET?

### Productive

.NET offers advanced language features like generics, LINQ, and asynchronous programming, along with extensive class libraries and multi-language support for developers.

The Visual Studio family provides powerful tooling for a seamless development experience,  
And Microsoft free developer program offers all the necessary resources to build and deploy your app on any platform.

.NET is the ultimate platform for developers who value productivity, performance, security, and reliability.

### Any App, Any Platform

With .NET you can target any application type running on any platform.  
Developers can reuse skills and code across all of them in a familiar environment.  
That means developers can build apps faster, with less cost.

From mobile applications running on iOS, Android, and Windows, to Enterprise server applications running on Windows Server and Linux, or high-scale microservices running in the cloud, .NET provides a solution for you.

### Loved by Developers

.NET is a modern, innovative, open source development platform and developers love it.  
.NET ranked as the #1 most-loved framework on the Stack Overflow Developer Survey for three years in a row (2019, 2020, and 2021).

### Performance Where It Matters

.NET is fast. Really fast! That means applications provide better response times and require less compute power.

The popular TechEmpower benchmark compares web application frameworks with tasks like JSON serialization, database access, and server side template rendering - .NET performs faster than any other popular framework.

### Trusted And Secure

The .NET platform is officially supported by Microsoft and trusted by thousands of companies and millions of developers.  
Microsoft takes security very seriously and releases updates quickly when threats are discovered.

### Large Ecosystem

With over 5,000,000 .NET developers worldwide, you can leverage the large ecosystem by incorporating libraries from the NuGet package manager and the Visual Studio Marketplace.  
Find answers to technical challenges from the community, our MVPs, and our large support organization.

### Open Source

The .NET Foundation is an independent non-profit supporting the innovative, commercially friendly, open source .NET ecosystem.  
.NET has over 100,000 contributions from developers from over 3,700 companies outside of Microsoft.

In addition to the community and Microsoft, Technical Steering Group members, Google, JetBrains, Red Hat, Samsung and Unity are guiding the future of the .NET platform.

## How to Use .NET?

### .NET Ecosystem

There are multiple variants of .NET, each supporting a different type of app.  
The reason for multiple variants is part historical, part technical.

.NET implementations (historical order):

#### .NET Framework

It provides access to the broad capabilities of Windows and Windows Server.  
Also extensively used for Windows-based cloud computing. The original .NET.

#### Mono

A cross-platform implementation of .NET Framework.  
The original community and open source .NET. Used for Android, iOS, and Wasm apps.

#### .NET (Core)

A cross-platform and open source implementation of .NET, rethought for the cloud age while remaining significantly compatible with .NET Framework.  
Used for Linux, macOS, and Windows apps.

### Languages

The runtime is designed to support multiple programming languages.  
You can write .NET apps in C#, F#, or Visual Basic.

#### C\#

C# is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language.  
It has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript programmers.

#### F\#

F# is an interoperable programming language for writing succinct, robust, and performant code.  
F# programming is data-oriented, where code involves transforming data with functions.

#### Visual Basic

Visual Basic uses a more verbose syntax that is closer to ordinary human language.  
It can be an easier language to learn for people new to programming.

### Binary Distributions

#### .NET SDK

Set of tools, libraries, and runtimes for development, building, and testing apps.

#### .NET Runtimes

Set of runtimes and libraries, for running apps.

## .NET History

In 2002, Microsoft released .NET Framework, a development platform for creating Windows apps.  
Today .NET Framework is at version 4.8 and remains fully supported by Microsoft.

In 2014, Microsoft introduced .NET Core as a cross-platform, open-source successor to .NET Framework.  
This new implementation of .NET kept the name .NET Core through version 3.1.  
The next version after .NET Core 3.1 dropped the "Core" part of the name and was named .NET 5.

New .NET versions continue to be released annually, each a major version number higher.  
They include significant new features and often enable new scenarios.
