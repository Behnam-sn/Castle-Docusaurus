# .NET

## What is .NET?

.NET is a free, cross-platform, open-source developer platform for building many kinds of applications.  
.NET is built on a high-performance runtime that is used in production by many high-scale apps.

## Languages

The runtime is designed to support multiple programming languages.  
C#, F#, and Visual Basic languages are supported by Microsoft and are designed in collaboration with the community.

### C\#

C# is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language.  
It has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript programmers.

### F\#

F# is an interoperable programming language for writing succinct, robust, and performant code.  
F# programming is data-oriented, where code involves transforming data with functions.

### Visual Basic

Visual Basic uses a more verbose syntax that is closer to ordinary human language.  
It can be an easier language to learn for people new to programming.

## Binary Distributions

### .NET SDK

Set of tools, libraries, and runtimes for development, building, and testing apps.

### .NET Runtimes

Set of runtimes and libraries, for running apps.

## Using .NET

.NET apps and libraries are built from source code and a project file,
Using the .NET CLI or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio.

## Tools

The .NET SDK is a set of libraries and tools for developing and running .NET applications.  
It includes the MSBuild build engine, the Roslyn (C# and Visual Basic) compiler, and the F# compiler.

Most commands are run by using the dotnet command.  
The CLI tools can be used for local development and continuous integration.

The Visual Studio family of IDEs offer excellent support for .NET and the C#, F#, and Visual Basic languages.

## .NET Ecosystem

There are multiple variants of .NET, each supporting a different type of app.  
The reason for multiple variants is part historical, part technical.

.NET implementations (historical order):

### .NET Framework

It provides access to the broad capabilities of Windows and Windows Server.  
 Also extensively used for Windows-based cloud computing. The original .NET.

### Mono

A cross-platform implementation of .NET Framework.  
 The original community and open source .NET. Used for Android, iOS, and Wasm apps.

### .NET (Core)

A cross-platform and open source implementation of .NET, rethought for the cloud age while remaining significantly compatible with .NET Framework.  
 Used for Linux, macOS, and Windows apps.

## .NET History

In 2002, Microsoft released .NET Framework, a development platform for creating Windows apps.  
Today .NET Framework is at version 4.8 and remains fully supported by Microsoft.

In 2014, Microsoft introduced .NET Core as a cross-platform, open-source successor to .NET Framework.  
This new implementation of .NET kept the name .NET Core through version 3.1.  
The next version after .NET Core 3.1 dropped the "Core" part of the name and was named .NET 5.

New .NET versions continue to be released annually, each a major version number higher.  
They include significant new features and often enable new scenarios.
