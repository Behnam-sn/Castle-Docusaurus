# SDK

The .NET SDK is a set of libraries and tools for developing and running .NET applications.  
It includes the MSBuild build engine, the Roslyn (C# and Visual Basic) compiler, and the F# compiler.

Most commands are run by using the dotnet command.  
The CLI tools can be used for local development and continuous integration.

The Visual Studio family of IDEs offer excellent support for .NET and the C#, F#, and Visual Basic languages.
