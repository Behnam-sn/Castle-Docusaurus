# languages

The runtime is designed to support multiple programming languages.  
You can write .NET apps in C#, F#, or Visual Basic.

## C\#

C# is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language.  
It has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript programmers.

## F\#

F# is an interoperable programming language for writing succinct, robust, and performant code.  
F# programming is data-oriented, where code involves transforming data with functions.

## Visual Basic

Visual Basic uses a more verbose syntax that is closer to ordinary human language.  
It can be an easier language to learn for people new to programming.
