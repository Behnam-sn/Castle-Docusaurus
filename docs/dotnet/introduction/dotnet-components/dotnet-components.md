# .NET Components

## What are .NET Components?

- ### Runtime

  Executes application code.

- ### Libraries

  Provides utility functionality like JSON parsing.

- ### Compiler

  Compiles C# (and other languages) source code into (runtime) executable code.

- ### SDK and Other Tools

  Enable building and monitoring apps with modern workflows.

- ### App Stacks

  Like ASP.NET Core and Blazor, that enable writing apps.

## Extras

### assembly

A .dll or .exe file that can contain a collection of APIs that can be called by applications or other assemblies.

An assembly may include types such as interfaces, classes, structures, enumerations, and delegates. Assemblies in a project's bin folder are sometimes referred to as binaries. See also library.

### NuGet Package Manager

NuGet is the package manager for .NET. It enables developers to share compiled binaries with each other.  
NuGet.org offers many popular packages from the community.

### SDK

The .NET SDK is a set of libraries and tools for developing and running .NET applications.  
It includes the MSBuild build engine, the Roslyn (C# and Visual Basic) compiler, and the F# compiler.

Most commands are run by using the dotnet command.  
The CLI tools can be used for local development and continuous integration.

The Visual Studio family of IDEs offer excellent support for .NET and the C#, F#, and Visual Basic languages.
