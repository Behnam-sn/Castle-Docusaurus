# .NET languages

## What are .NET languages?

The .NET runtime is designed to support multiple programming languages.

Microsoft offers 3 languages on the .NET platform:

- ### C\#

  C# is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language.  
  C# is the primary programming language for .NET and much of .NET is written in C#

  It has its roots in the C family of languages,  
  And will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript programmers.

- ### F\#

  F# is an interoperable programming language for writing succinct, robust, and performant code.

  F# programming is data-oriented,  
  Where code involves transforming data with functions.

- ### Visual Basic

  Visual Basic uses a more verbose syntax that is closer to ordinary human language.  
   It can be an easier language to learn for people new to programming.
