# OOP

## OO Basics

- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance

## OO Principles

- Encapsulate what varies
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Program to interfaces, not implementations
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact
- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
- Depend upon abstractions, Do not depend upon concrete classes
- Talk only to your friends
- Don’t call us, we’ll call you
- A class should have only one reason to change
