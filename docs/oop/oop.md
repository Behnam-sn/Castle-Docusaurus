# OOP

## OO Basics

- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance

## OO Principles

- Encapsulate what varies.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
- Program to interfaces, not implementations.
- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
- Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- Depend upon abstractions, Do not depend upon concrete classes.
- Only talk to your friends.
- Don’t call us, we’ll call you.
- A class should have only one reason to change.
