# Entity Framework

## What is the Entity Framework?

Entity Framework is a modern object-relation mapper (ORM)  
That lets you build a clean, portable, and high-level data access layer with .NET (C#)  
Across a variety of databases, including SQL Database (on-premises and Azure), SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Azure Cosmos DB.  
It supports LINQ queries, change tracking, updates, and schema migrations.

## Entity Framework Evolution

Entity Framework was first released in 2008 as part of the .NET Framework.  
Since then it has gone through several evolutions:

- The first version of Entity Framework and Entity Framework 4 are fully contained in the .NET Framework
- Entity Framework 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, and 5.0 have some code in the .NET Framework, and some code shipped as NuGet packages
- Entity Framework 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4 are shipped entirely as NuGet packages
- Entity Framework Core (all versions) is an entirely separate codebase and ships as NuGet packages
