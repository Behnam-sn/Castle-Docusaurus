# Entity Framework Core

Entity Framework (EF) Core is a lightweight, extensible, open source and cross-platform version of the popular Entity Framework data access technology.

EF Core can serve as an object-relational mapper (O/RM),  
Which enables .NET developers to work with a database using .NET objects.  
And eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that typically needs to be written.
