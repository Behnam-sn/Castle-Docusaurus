# On Technology

When confronted with technological advances, we often overestimate their
potential in the short term and underestimate what will actually happen in
the long term. Short-term hype results from the desires of industry, academia,
funding agencies, and financial institutions to make the most of new ideas in as
short a time span as possible. Long-term unpredictability reflects the chaotic
nature of the process whereby society adopts new technologies.

Web
services as they are now may disappear in a few years, but the problems that
Web services are trying to tackle will not go away.

Whether the solution is
called Web services or something else, what matters is to have a solid understanding of the problems that must be solved and of the constraints associated
with realistic solutions.
