# It’s Your Life

It is your life. You own it. You run it. You create it.

Many developers we talk to are frustrated. Their concerns are varied. Some
feel they’re stagnating in their job, others that technology has passed them
by. Folks feel they are under appreciated, or underpaid, or that their teams
are toxic. Maybe they want to move to Asia, or Europe, or work from home.

And the answer we give is always the same.
“Why can’t you change it?”

Software development must appear close to the top of any list of careers where
you have control. Our skills are in demand, our knowledge crosses geographic
boundaries, we can work remotely. We’re paid well. We really can do just
about anything we want.

But, for some reason, developers seem to resist change. They hunker down,
and hope things will get better. They look on, passively, as their skills become
dated and complain that their companies don’t train them. They look at ads
for exotic locations on the bus, then step off into the chilling rain and trudge
into work.

## You Have Agency

Does your work environment suck? Is your job boring? Try to fix it. But don’t
try forever. As Martin Fowler says, “you can change your organization or
change your organization.”

If technology seems to be passing you by, make time (in your own time) to
study new stuff that looks interesting. You’re investing in yourself, so doing
it while you’re off-the-clock is only reasonable.

Want to work remotely? Have you asked? If they say no, then find someone
who says yes.

This industry gives you a remarkable set of opportunities. Be proactive, and
take them.
