# Tactical Design

The second stage of a DDD-based project is “tactical design,”
where we transform the discoveries of strategic design into software architecture and implementation.

Again, DDD provides guidance and patterns for organizing these domains and avoiding further complexity.  
Tactical design continues the partnership with the domain experts who will recognize their domain language even as they look at the code built by the software teams.

Domain-driven design’s tactical tools address a different aspect of communication issues.  
DDD’s tactical patterns allow us to write code in a way that reflects the business domain, addresses its goals, and speaks the language of the business.
