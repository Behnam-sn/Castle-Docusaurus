# Tactical Design

The second stage of a DDD-based project is **tactical design**.  
Where we transform the discoveries of strategic design into software architecture and implementation.

DDD’s tactical patterns allow us to write code in a way that reflects the business domain, addresses its goals, and speaks the language of the business.

Business logic is the most important part of software.  
It’s the reason the software is being implemented in the first place.  
A system’s UI can be beautiful and its database can be blazing fast and scalable.  
But if the software is not useful for the business, it’s nothing but an expensive technology demo.
