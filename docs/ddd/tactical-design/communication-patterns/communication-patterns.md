# Communication Patterns

## What are Communication Patterns?

Up this point you learn about,  
Tactical design patterns that define the different ways to implement a system’s components:

- How to model the business logic
- And how to organize the internals of a bounded context architecturally

In this chapter,  
We will step beyond the boundaries of a single component,  
And discuss the patterns for organizing the flow of communication across a system’s elements.

The patterns you will learn about in this chapter facilitate cross-bounded context communication,  
Address the limitations imposed by aggregate design principles,  
And orchestrate business processes spanning multiple system components.
