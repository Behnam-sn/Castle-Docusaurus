# DDD

## What is DDD?

Domain-driven design (DDD) is a major software design methodology.  
DDD is focusing on tackling complexity and providing a path to clarity.

DDD provide tools and techniques for modeling and effectively implementing software.  
It also illuminates an often-overlooked aspect of software engineering: the context.

DDD was originally invented by Eric Evans in 2003,  
With the publication of Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software.

## What Problem is DDD Trying to Solve?

Software engineering is hard.  
To be successful at it, we have to learn continuously,  
Whether it’s trying new languages, exploring new technologies, or keeping up with
new popular frameworks.

However, learning a new JavaScript framework every week is not the hardest aspect of our job.  
Making sense of new business domains can be far more challenging.

Throughout our careers, it’s not uncommon for us to have to develop software for a diverse range of business domains: financial systems, medical software, online retailers, marketing, and many others.  
In a sense, that is what differentiates our job from most other professions.

People working in other fields are often surprised when they find out how much learning is involved in software engineering, especially when
changing workplaces.

Failure to grasp the business domain, results in suboptimal implementation of the business software.

Unfortunately, that’s quite common.  
According to studies, approximately 70% of software projects are not delivered on time, on budget, or according to the client’s requirements.

In other words, the vast majority of software projects fail.  
This issue is so deep and widespread that we even have a term for it: software crisis.

The term software crisis was introduced all the way back in 1968.  
One would assume that things would have improved in the intervening 50 years.

During those years,  
numerous approaches, methodologies, and disciplines were introduced to make software engineering more effective like
Agile Manifesto, extreme programming, test-driven development, high-level languages, DevOps, and others.

Unfortunately, things didn’t change much.  
Projects are still failing quite often and the software crisis is still here.

**Many studies have been conducted to investigate the reasons for the common project failures.**  
**Although researchers have not been able to pinpoint a single cause,**  
**But most of their findings share a common theme: Communication.**

Communication issues thwarting projects can manifest themselves in different ways.  
For example unclear requirements, uncertain project goals, or ineffective coordination of effort between teams.

Yet again, over the years, we have tried to improve inter and intra team communication by introducing new communication opportunities, processes, and mediums.

Unfortunately, the success rates of our projects still didn’t change much.

## What is DDD Solution?

Domain-driven design (DDD) proposes to attack the root cause for failed software projects from a different angle.  
Effective communication is the central theme of the domain-driven design tools and practices.

DDD will make you a more effective software engineer by  
Alleviating the process of making sense of business domains,  
And guiding the design decisions according to the business strategy.

Equipped with the knowledge of the system’s business problem,  
You will be much more effective at choosing the appropriate solution.  
A solution that is not under or over engineered, but addresses business needs and goals.

As you will learn the tighter the connection between the software design and its business strategy is,  
The easier it will be to maintain and evolve the system to meet the future needs of the business,  
Ultimately leading to more successful software projects.

## How to Use DDD?

The domain-driven design (DDD) methodology can be divided into 2 main parts:

- ### Strategic Design

  The strategic aspect of DDD deals with answering the questions of **What?** and **Why?**.  
  What software we are building and Why we are building it.

- ### Tactical Design

  The tactical part is all about the **How?**.  
  How each component is implemented.

Both the strategic and tactical patterns and practices of DDD align software design with its business domain.  
That’s where the name comes from: (business) domain-driven (software) design.
