# Domain Experts

Now that we have a clear understanding of business domains and subdomains, let’s
take a look at another DDD term that we will use often in the following chapters:
domain experts. Domain experts are subject matter experts who know all the intrica‐
cies of the business that we are going to model and implement in code. In other
words, domain experts are knowledge authorities in the software’s business domain.
The domain experts are neither the analysts gathering the requirements nor the engi‐
neers designing the system. Domain experts represent the business. They are the peo‐
ple who identified the business problem in the first place and from whom all business
knowledge originates. Systems analysts and engineers are transforming their mental
models of the business domain into software requirements and source code.
As a rule of thumb, domain experts are either the people coming up with require‐
ments or the software’s end users. The software is supposed to solve their problems.
The domain experts’ expertise can have different scopes. Some subject matter experts
will have a detailed understanding of how the entire business domain operates, while
others will specialize in particular subdomains. For example, in an online advertising
agency, the domain experts would be campaign managers, media buyers, analysts,
and other business stakeholders.

domain experts are the business’s subject matter experts.
They have in-depth knowledge of the company’s business domain or one or more of
its subdomains and are critical to a project’s success.
