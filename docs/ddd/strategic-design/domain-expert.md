# Domain Expert

## Who Is The Domain Expert?

Domain expert is the business’s subject matter expert.  
They have in-depth knowledge of the company’s business domain,  
in one or more of its subdomains and are critical to a project’s success.

The domain experts are neither the analysts gathering the requirements nor the engineers designing the system.  
Domain experts represent the business.

They are the people who identified the business problem in the first place  
and from whom all business knowledge originates.

Systems analysts and engineers are transforming their mental models of the business domain into software requirements and source code.  
The software is supposed to solve their problems.

The domain experts’ expertise can have different scopes.  
Some subject matter experts will have a detailed understanding of how the entire business domain operates,  
while others will specialize in particular subdomains.

For example,  
in an online advertising agency,  
the domain experts would be campaign managers, media buyers, analysts, and other business stakeholders.
