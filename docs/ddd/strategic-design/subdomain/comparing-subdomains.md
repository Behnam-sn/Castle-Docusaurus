# Comparing Subdomains

Now that we have a greater understanding of the three types of business subdomains,  
let’s explore their differences from additional angles and see how they affect strategic software design decisions.

## The Comparison Table

| Subdomain type | Competitive advantage | Complexity | Volatility |   Implementation   |   Problem   |
| :------------: | :-------------------: | :--------: | :--------: | :----------------: | :---------: |
|      Core      |          Yes          |    High    |    High    |      In-house      | Interesting |
|    Generic     |          No           |    High    |    Low     |     Buy/Adopt      |   Solved    |
|   Supporting   |          No           |    Low     |    Low     | In-house/Outsource |   Obvious   |

## Subdomains Importance

Core subdomains provide the company its ability to compete with other players in the industry.  
That’s a business-critical responsibility,  
but does it mean that supporting and generic subdomains are not important? Of course not.

All subdomains are required for the company to work in its business domain.  
The subdomains are like foundational building blocks: take one away and the whole structure may fall down.

That said, we can leverage the inherent properties of the different types of subdomains to choose implementation strategies to implement each type of subdomain in the most efficient manner.

From a more technical perspective,  
it’s important to identify the core subdomains whose complexity will affect software design.  
because when we are designing the software,  
we have to choose tools and techniques that accommodate the complexity of the business requirements.
