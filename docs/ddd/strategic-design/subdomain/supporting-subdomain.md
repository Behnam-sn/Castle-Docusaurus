# Supporting Subdomain

## What Is a Supporting Subdomain?

As the name suggests, supporting subdomains support the company’s business.

## Example

Consider an online advertising company,  
whose core subdomains include matching ads to visitors, optimizing the ads’ effectiveness, and minimizing the cost of ad space.

However, to achieve success in these areas, the company needs to catalog its creative materials.  
The way the company stores and indexes its physical creative materials, such as banners and landing pages, does not impact its profits.

There is nothing to invent or optimize in that area.  
On the other hand,  
the creative catalog is essential for implementing the company’s advertising management and serving systems.  
That makes the content cataloging solution one of the company’s supporting subdomains.

## Competitive Advantage

Supporting subdomains have low entry barriers and cannot provide a competitive advantage.  
Usually, a company wouldn’t mind its competitors copying its supporting subdomains this won’t affect its competitiveness in the industry.

## Complexity

The distinctive characteristic of supporting subdomains is the complexity of the solution’s business logic.  
Supporting subdomains are simple.

These are basic ETL (extract, transform, load) operations and CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) interfaces, and the business logic is obvious.  
Often, it doesn’t go beyond validating inputs or converting data from one structure to another.

## Implementation

Lack of competitive advantage makes it reasonable to avoid implementing supporting subdomains in-house.

Strategically the company would prefer its supporting subdomains to be generic, ready-made solutions,  
thus eliminating the need to design and build their implementation.

However, unlike generic subdomains, no ready-made solutions are available.  
So, a company has no choice but to implement supporting subdomains itself.

From a staffing perspective, supporting subdomains do not require highly skilled technical aptitude and provide a great opportunity to train up-and-coming talent.

Supporting subdomains do not require elaborate design patterns or other advanced engineering techniques.  
A rapid application development framework will suffice to implement the business logic without introducing accidental complexities.

Also, the simplicity of the business logic and infrequency of changes make it good candidate for outsourcing.

## Volatility

Supporting subdomains do not change often.  
They do not provide any competitive advantage for the company,  
and therefore the evolution of a supporting subdomain provides a very small business value compared to the same effort invested in a core subdomain.
