# Generic Subdomains

Generic subdomains are business activities that all companies are performing in the same way.  
Like core subdomains, generic subdomains are generally complex and hard to implement.  
However, generic subdomains do not provide any competitive edge for the company.  
There is no need for innovation or optimization here:  
battle tested implementations are widely available, and all companies use them.

For example, most systems need to authenticate and authorize their users. Instead of
inventing a proprietary authentication mechanism, it makes more sense to use an
existing solution. Such a solution is likely to be more reliable and secure since it has
already been tested by many other companies that have the same needs.
Going back to the example of a jewelry maker selling its products online, jewelry
design is a core subdomain, but the online shop is a generic subdomain. Using the
same online retail platform—the same generic solution—as its competitors would not
impact the jewelry maker’s competitive advantage.
