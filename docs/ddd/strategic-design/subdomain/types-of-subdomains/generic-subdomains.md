# Generic Subdomains

Generic subdomains are business activities that all companies are performing in the same way.

Like core subdomains, generic subdomains are generally complex and hard to implement.  
However, generic subdomains do not provide any competitive edge for the company.  
There is no need for innovation or optimization here:  
battle tested implementations are widely available, and all companies use them.

## Example

Most systems need to authenticate and authorize their users.  
Instead of inventing a proprietary authentication mechanism, it makes more sense to use an existing solution.

Such a solution is likely to be more reliable and secure since it has already been tested by many other companies that have the same needs.

Going back to the example of a jewelry maker selling its products online,  
jewelry design is a core subdomain, but the online shop is a generic subdomain.  
Using the same online retail platform (the same generic solution) as its competitors would not impact the jewelry maker’s competitive advantage.

## Competitive Advantage

Generic subdomains, by definition, cannot be a source for any competitive advantage.  
These are generic solutions the same solutions used by the company and its competitors.

## Complexity

Generic subdomains are complicated.  
There should be a good reason why others have already invested time and effort in solving these problems.  
These solutions are neither simple nor trivial.  
Consider, for example, encryption algorithms or authentication mechanisms.

From a knowledge availability perspective, generic subdomains are “known unknowns.”  
These are the things that you know you don’t know.

Furthermore, this knowledge is readily available.  
You can either use industry-accepted best practices or,  
if needed, hire a consultant specializing in the area to help design a custom solution.

## Implementation

Since generic subdomains are hard but already solved problems,  
it’s more cost effective to buy an off-the-shelf product or adopt an open source solution  
than invest time and effort into implementing a generic subdomain in-house.

## Volatility

Despite having existing solutions, generic subdomains can change over time.  
The changes can come in the form of security patches, bug fixes,  
or entirely new solutions to the generic problems.
