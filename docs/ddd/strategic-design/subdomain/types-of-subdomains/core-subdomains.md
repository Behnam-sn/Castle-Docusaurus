# Core Subdomains

A core subdomain is what a company does differently from its competitors.  
This may involve inventing new products or services or reducing costs by optimizing existing processes.

## Example

Uber  
Initially the company provided a novel form of transportation: ride sharing.

As its competitors caught up,  
Uber found ways to optimize and evolve its core business.  
for example, reducing costs by matching riders heading in the same direction

Uber’s core subdomains affect its bottom line.  
This is how the company differentiates itself from its competitors.  
This is the company’s strategy for providing better service to its customers and/or maximizing its profitability.  
To maintain a competitive advantage, core subdomains involve inventions, smart optimizations, business know how, or other intellectual property.

## Another Example

Google Search’s ranking algorithm  
At the time of this writing, Google’s advertising platform accounts for the majority of its profits.

That said, Google Ads is not a subdomain,  
but rather a separate business domain with subdomains comprising it,  
among its cloud computing service (Google Cloud Platform), productivity and collaboration tools (Google Workspaces), and other fields in which Alphabet, Google’s parent company, operates.

But what about Google Search and its ranking algorithm?  
Although the search engine is not a paid service, it serves as the largest display platform for Google Ads.

Its ability to provide excellent search results is what drives traffic, and subsequently,  
it is an important component of the Ads platform.

Serving suboptimal search results due to a bug in the algorithm or a competitor coming up with an even better search service will hurt the ad business’s revenue.

So, for Google, the ranking algorithm is a core subdomain.
