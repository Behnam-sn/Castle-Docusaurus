# Supporting Subdomains

As the name suggests, supporting subdomains support the company’s business.  
However, contrary to core subdomains, supporting subdomains do not provide any competitive advantage.

The distinctive characteristic of supporting subdomains is the complexity of the solution’s business logic.  
Supporting subdomains are simple.  
Their business logic resembles mostly data entry screens and ETL (extract, transform, load) operations;  
that is, the so-called CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) interfaces.

These activity areas do not provide any competitive advantage for the company,  
and therefore do not require high entry barriers.

## Example

Consider an online advertising company,  
whose core subdomains include matching ads to visitors, optimizing the ads’ effectiveness, and minimizing the cost of ad space.

However, to achieve success in these areas, the company needs to catalog its creative materials.  
The way the company stores and indexes its physical creative materials, such as banners and landing pages, does not impact its profits.

There is nothing to invent or optimize in that area.  
On the other hand,  
the creative catalog is essential for implementing the company’s advertising management and serving systems.  
That makes the content cataloging solution one of the company’s supporting subdomains.
