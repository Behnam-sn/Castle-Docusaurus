# Types of Subdomains

Domain-driven design distinguishes between 3 types of subdomains:

- ## Core Subdomains

  The interesting problems.  
  These are the activities the company is performing differently from its competitors and  
  from which it gains its competitive advantage.

- ## Generic Subdomains

  The solved problems.  
  These are the things all companies are doing in the same way.  
  There is no room or need for innovation here;  
  rather than creating in-house implementations, itâ€™s more cost-effective to use existing solutions.

- ## Supporting Subdomains

  The problems with obvious solutions.  
  These are the activities the company likely has to implement in-house,  
  but that do not provide any competitive advantage.
