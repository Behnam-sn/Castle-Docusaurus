# Volatility

As mentioned previously, core subdomains can change often. If a problem can be
solved on the first attempt, it’s probably not a good competitive advantage—competi‐
tors will catch up fast. Consequently, solutions for core subdomains are emergent.
Different implementations have to be tried out, refined, and optimized. Moreover, the
work on core subdomains is never done. Companies continuously innovate and
evolve core subdomains. The changes come in the form of adding new features or
optimizing existing functionality. Either way, the constant evolution of its core sub‐
domains is essential for a company to stay ahead of its competitors.
Contrary to the core subdomains, supporting subdomains do not change often. They
do not provide any competitive advantage for the company, and therefore the evolu‐
tion of a supporting subdomain provides a minuscule business value compared to the
same effort invested in a core subdomain.
Despite having existing solutions, generic subdomains can change over time. The
changes can come in the form of security patches, bug fixes, or entirely new solutions
to the generic problems.
