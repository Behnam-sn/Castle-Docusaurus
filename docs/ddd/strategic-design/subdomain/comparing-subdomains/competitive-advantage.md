# Competitive Advantage

- ## Core Subdomains

  Only core subdomains provide a competitive advantage to a company.  
  Core subdomains are the company’s strategy for differentiating itself from its competitors.

- ## Generic Subdomains

  Generic subdomains, by definition, cannot be a source for any competitive advantage.  
  These are generic solutions the same solutions used by the company and its competitors.

- ## Supporting Subdomains

  Supporting subdomains have low entry barriers and cannot provide a competitive advantage either.  
  Usually, a company wouldn’t mind its competitors copying its supporting subdomains this won’t affect its competitiveness in the industry.  
  On the contrary, strategically the company would prefer its supporting subdomains to be generic, ready-made solutions, thus eliminating the need to design and build their implementation.

The more complex the problems a company is able to tackle, the more business value it can provide.  
The complex problems are not limited to delivering services to consumers.

A complex problem can be, for example, making the business more optimized and efficient.  
Or, providing the same level of service as competitors do, but at lower operational costs, is a competitive advantage as well.
