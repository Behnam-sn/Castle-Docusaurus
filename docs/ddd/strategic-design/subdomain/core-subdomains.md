# Core Subdomains

## What Is a Core Subdomain?

A core subdomain is what a company does differently from its competitors.  
This may involve inventing new products or services or reducing costs by optimizing existing processes.

## Example

Uber  
Initially the company provided a novel form of transportation: ride sharing.

As its competitors caught up,  
Uber found ways to optimize and evolve its core business.  
for example, reducing costs by matching riders heading in the same direction

Uber’s core subdomains affect its bottom line.  
This is how the company differentiates itself from its competitors.  
This is the company’s strategy for providing better service to its customers and/or maximizing its profitability.  
To maintain a competitive advantage, core subdomains involve inventions, smart optimizations, business know how, or other intellectual property.

## Another Example

Google Search’s ranking algorithm  
At the time of this writing, Google’s advertising platform accounts for the majority of its profits.

That said, Google Ads is not a subdomain,  
but rather a separate business domain with subdomains comprising it,  
among its cloud computing service (Google Cloud Platform), productivity and collaboration tools (Google Workspaces), and other fields in which Alphabet, Google’s parent company, operates.

But what about Google Search and its ranking algorithm?  
Although the search engine is not a paid service, it serves as the largest display platform for Google Ads.

Its ability to provide excellent search results is what drives traffic, and subsequently,  
it is an important component of the Ads platform.

Serving suboptimal search results due to a bug in the algorithm or a competitor coming up with an even better search service will hurt the ad business’s revenue.

So, for Google, the ranking algorithm is a core subdomain.

## Competitive Advantage

Only core subdomains provide a competitive advantage to a company.  
Core subdomains are the company’s strategy for differentiating itself from its competitors.

The more complex the problems a company is able to tackle, the more business value it can provide.  
The complex problems are not limited to delivering services to consumers.

A complex problem can be, for example, making the business more optimized and efficient.  
Or, providing the same level of service as competitors do, but at lower operational costs, is a competitive advantage as well.

:::note
It’s important to note that core subdomains are not necessarily technical.  
Not all business problems are solved through algorithms or other technical solutions.  
A company’s competitive advantage can come from various sources.

Consider, for example, a jewelry maker selling its products online.  
The online shop is important, but it’s not a core subdomain.  
The jewelry design is.  
The company can use an existing off-the-shelf online shop engine,  
but it cannot outsource the design of its jewelry.  
The design is the reason customers buy the jewelry maker’s products and remember the brand.

## Complexity

A core subdomain that is simple to implement can only provide a short lived competitive advantage.  
Therefore, core subdomains are naturally complex.

They should be as hard for competitors to copy as possible the company’s profitability depends on it.  
That’s why strategically, companies are looking to solve complex problems as their core subdomains.

Continuing with the Uber example,  
the company not only created a new marketspace with ride sharing,  
it disrupted a decades-old monolithic architecture, the taxi industry, through targeted use of technology.

By understanding its business domain,  
Uber was able to design a more reliable and transparent method of transportation.

There should be high entry barriers for a company’s core business;  
it should be hard for competitors to copy or imitate the company’s solution.

## Implementation

Core subdomains have to be implemented in-house.  
They cannot be bought or adopted;  
that would undermine the notion of competitive advantage, as the company’s competitors would be able to do the same.

It would also be unwise to outsource the implementation of a core subdomain.  
It is a strategic investment. Cutting corners on a core subdomain is not only risky in the short term but can have fatal consequences in the long run:  
for example, unmaintainable codebases that cannot support the company’s goals and objectives.  
The organization’s most skilled talent should be assigned to work on its core subdomains.

Furthermore, implementing core subdomains in-house allows the company to make
changes and evolve the solution more quickly, and therefore build the competitive
advantage in less time.

Since core subdomains’ requirements are expected to change often and continuously,  
the solution must be maintainable and easy to evolve.  
Thus, core subdomains require implementation of the most advanced engineering techniques.

Save the engineers on your team who are experienced in tackling complex challenges
for the core subdomains.

## Volatility

Core subdomains can change often.  
If a problem can be solved on the first attempt,  
it’s probably not a good competitive advantage & competitors will catch up fast.

Consequently, solutions for core subdomains are emergent.  
Different implementations have to be tried out, refined, and optimized.  
Moreover, the work on core subdomains is never done.

Companies continuously innovate and evolve core subdomains.  
The changes come in the form of adding new features or optimizing existing functionality.  
Either way, the constant evolution of its core subdomains is essential for a company to stay ahead of its competitors.
