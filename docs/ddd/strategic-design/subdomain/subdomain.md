# Subdomain

A subdomain is a fine-grained area of business activity.  
All of a company’s subdomains form its business domain: the service it provides to its customers.

Implementing a single subdomain is not enough for a company to succeed.  
A company has to operate in multiple subdomains,  
and the subdomains have to interact with each other to achieve the company’s goals and targets in the business domain.

For example:  
Starbucks may be most recognized for its coffee,  
but building a successful coffeehouse chain requires more than just knowing how to make great coffee.  
You also have to buy or rent real estate at effective locations, hire personnel, and manage finances, among other activities.

None of these subdomains on its own will make a profitable company.  
All of them together are necessary for a company to be able to compete in its business domain(s).

## Types of Subdomains

Domain-driven design distinguishes between 3 types of subdomains:

- ### Core Subdomains

  The interesting problems.  
  These are the activities the company is performing differently from its competitors  
  and from which it gains its competitive advantage.

- ### Generic Subdomains

  The solved problems.  
  These are the things all companies are doing in the same way.  
  There is no room or need for innovation here;  
  rather than creating in-house implementations, it’s more cost-effective to use existing solutions.

- ### Supporting Subdomains

  The problems with obvious solutions.  
  These are the activities the company likely has to implement in-house,  
  but that do not provide any competitive advantage.
