# Business Domain

To design and build an effective solution, you have to understand the problem.  
The problem, in our context, is the software system we have to build.

To understand the problem,  
you have to understand the context within which it exists the organization’s business strategy,  
and what value it seeks to gain by building the software.

This material is the groundwork for designing software.  
you will learn how companies work:  
why they exist, what goals they are pursuing, and their strategies for achieving their goals.

## What Is a Business Domain?

A business domain defines a company’s main area of activity.  
Generally speaking, it’s the service the company provides to its clients. For example:

- FedEx provides courier delivery
- Starbucks is best known for its coffee
- Walmart is one of the most widely recognized retail establishments

A company can operate in multiple business domains. For example:

- Amazon provides both retail and cloud computing services
- Uber is a ride share company that also provides food delivery and bicycle-sharing services

:::note
It’s important to note that companies may change their business domains often.  
A canonical example of this is Nokia,  
which over the years has operated in fields as diverse as wood processing, rubber manufacturing, telecommunications, and mobile communications.
