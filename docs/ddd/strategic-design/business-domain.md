# Business Domain

A business domain defines a company’s main area of activity.  
Generally speaking, it’s the service the company provides to its clients. For example:

- FedEx provides courier delivery
- Starbucks is best known for its coffee
- Walmart is one of the most widely recognized retail establishments

A company can operate in multiple business domains. For example:

- Amazon provides both retail and cloud computing services
- Uber is a ride share company that also provides food delivery and bicycle-sharing services

It’s important to note that companies may change their business domains often.  
A canonical example of this is Nokia,  
which over the years has operated in fields as diverse as wood processing, rubber manufacturing, telecommunications, and mobile communications.
