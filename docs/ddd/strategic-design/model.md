# Model

## What is a Model?

> A model is a simplified representation of a thing or phenomenon  
> That intentionally emphasizes certain aspects while ignoring others.  
> Abstraction with a specific use in mind.  
> — Rebecca Wirfs-Brock

A model is not a copy of the real world but a human construct that helps us make sense of real-world systems.

## What is an Example of a Model?

A canonical example of a model is a map.

Any map is a model,  
Including navigation maps, terrain maps, world maps, subway maps, and others.

## How to Model Effectively?

A useful model is not a copy of the real world.  
Instead, a model is intended to solve a problem,  
And it should provide just enough information for that purpose.

As statistician George Box puts it:

> All models are wrong, but some are useful.

None of these maps represents all the details of our planet.  
For example, you won’t see subway stops on a world map.  
On the other hand, you cannot use a subway map to estimate distances.

Each map contains just enough data to support its particular purpose:  
The problem it is supposed to solve.
