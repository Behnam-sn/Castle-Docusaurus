# Model

## What is a Model?

A model is not a copy of the real world but a human construct that helps us make sense of real-world systems.

## What is an Example of a Model?

A canonical example of a model is a map.

Any map is a model, including navigation maps, terrain maps, world maps, subway maps, and others.

None of these maps represents all the details of our planet.  
Instead, each map contains just enough data to support its particular purpose:  
The problem it is supposed to solve.

## How to Model Effectively?

A useful model is not a copy of the real world.  
Instead, a model is intended to solve a problem,  
And it should provide just enough information for that purpose.

As statistician George Box puts it:

> All models are wrong, but some are useful.

For example, you won’t see subway stops on a world map.  
On the other hand, you cannot use a subway map to estimate distances.

Each map contains just the information it is supposed to provide.

In its essence, a model is an abstraction.  
The notion of abstraction allows us to handle complexity by omitting unnecessary details and leaving only what’s needed for solving the problem at hand.  
On the other hand, an ineffective abstraction removes necessary information or produces noise by leaving what’s not required.

As noted by Edsger W. Dijkstra in his paper “The Humble Programmer":

> The purpose of abstracting is not to be vague but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise.
