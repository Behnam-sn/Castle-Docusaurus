# Ubiquitous Language & Bounded Context

Bounded contexts allow us to complete the definition of a ubiquitous language.  
A ubiquitous language is not “ubiquitous” in the sense that it should be used and applied “ubiquitously” throughout the organization.

A ubiquitous language is not universal.  
Instead, a ubiquitous language is ubiquitous only in the boundaries of its bounded context.

The language is focused on describing only the model that is encompassed by the bounded context.  
As a model cannot exist without a problem it is supposed to address, a ubiquitous language cannot be defined or used without an explicit context of its applicability.
