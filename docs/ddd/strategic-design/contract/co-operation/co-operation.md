# Co-Operation

## What are Co-Operation Patterns?

Co-Operation patterns relate to bounded contexts implemented by teams with well established communication.

## When to Use Co-Operation Patterns?

In the simplest case,  
These are bounded contexts implemented by a single team.

This also applies to teams with dependent goals,  
Where one team’s success depends on the success of the other, and vice versa.

Again, the main criterion here is the quality of the teams’ communication and collaboration.

## Types of Co-Operation Patterns

DDD has 2 patterns suitable for cooperating teams:

- ### Partnership

  Bounded contexts are integrated in an ad hoc manner.

- ### Shared Kernel

  Two or more bounded contexts are integrated by sharing a limited overlapping model that belongs to all participating bounded contexts.
