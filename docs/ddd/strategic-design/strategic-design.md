# Strategic Design

## What Is Strategic Design?

The strategic tools of DDD are used to analyze business domains and strategy,  
and to foster a shared understanding of the business between the different stakeholders.

We use strategic design tools to understand the business problem (the domain),  
and break the problem down into smaller, solvable, interconnected problems.

We will also use this knowledge of the business domain to drive high-level design decisions:  
decomposing systems into components and defining their integration patterns.
