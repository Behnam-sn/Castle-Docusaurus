# Strategic Design

## What is Strategic Design?

The strategic aspect of DDD deals with answering the questions of **What?** and **Why?**.  
What software we are building and Why we are building it.

## What Problem is Strategic Design Trying to Solve?

To design and build an effective solution, you have to understand the problem.  
The problem, in our context, is the software system we have to build.

To understand the problem,  
You have to understand the context within which it exists the organization’s business strategy,  
And what value it seeks to gain by building the software.

You need to know:

- How companies work?
- Why they exist?
- What goals they are pursuing?
- And what is their strategies for achieving their goals?

## What is Strategic Design Solution?

The strategic tools of DDD are used to analyze business domains and strategy,  
And to foster a shared understanding of the business between the different stakeholders.

We use strategic design tools to understand the business problem (the domain),  
And break the problem down into smaller, solvable, interconnected problems.

We will also use this knowledge of the business domain to drive high-level design decisions:  
Decomposing systems into components and defining their integration patterns.

This article, however, has nothing to do with writing code.  
But this material is the groundwork for designing software.
