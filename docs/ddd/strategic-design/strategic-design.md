# Strategic Design

We use **strategic design** tools to understand the business problem (the domain),  
and break the problem down into smaller, solvable, interconnected problems.

The partnership with the domain experts also drives us to communicate in the language of the domain,  
rather than forcing those on the business side to learn the technical language of software.

The strategic tools of DDD are used to analyze business domains and strategy,  
and to foster a shared understanding of the business between the different stakeholders.

We will also use this knowledge of the business domain to drive high-level design decisions:  
decomposing systems into components and defining their integration patterns.
