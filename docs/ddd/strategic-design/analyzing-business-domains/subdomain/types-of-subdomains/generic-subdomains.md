# Generic Subdomains

Generic subdomains are business activities that all companies are performing in the same way.  
Like core subdomains, generic subdomains are generally complex and hard to implement.  
However, generic subdomains do not provide any competitive edge for the company.  
There is no need for innovation or optimization here:  
battle tested implementations are widely available, and all companies use them.
