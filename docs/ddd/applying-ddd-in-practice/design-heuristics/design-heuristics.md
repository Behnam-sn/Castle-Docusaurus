# Design Heuristics

“It depends” is the correct answer to almost any question in software engineering, but
not really practical. In this chapter, we will explore what “it” depends on.
In Part I of the book, you learned domain-driven design tools for analyzing business
domains and making strategic design decisions. In Part II, we explored tactical design
patterns: the different ways to implement business logic, organize system architec‐
ture, and establish communication between a system’s components. This chapter
bridges Parts I and II. You will learn heuristics for applying analysis tools to drive var‐
ious software design decisions: that is, (business) domain-driven (software) design.
But first, since this chapter is about design heuristics, let’s start by defining the term
heuristic.

## Heuristic

A heuristic is not a hard rule that is guaranteed and mathematically proven to be cor‐
rect in 100% of cases. Rather, it’s a rule of thumb: not guaranteed to be perfect, yet
sufficient for one’s immediate goals. In other words, using heuristics is an effective
problem-solving approach that ignores the noise inherent in many cues, focusing
instead on the “swamping forces” reflected in the most important cues.

The heuristics presented in this chapter focus on the essential properties of the differ‐
ent business domains and on the essence of the problems addressed by the various
design decisions.
