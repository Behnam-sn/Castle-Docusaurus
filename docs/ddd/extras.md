Effective communication and knowledge sharing are crucial for a successful software project.  
Software engineers have to understand the business domain in order to design and build a software solution.

## Business Problems

The software systems we are building are solutions to business problems.  
In this context, a business problem can be challenges associated with optimizing workflows and processes, minimizing manual labor, managing resources, supporting decisions, managing data, and so on.

In that case, they won’t be able to completely understand the business logic or why it operates the way it does, which will limit their ability to model and implement an effective solution.

Again, DDD provides guidance and patterns for organizing these domains and avoiding further complexity.  
Tactical design continues the partnership with the domain experts who will recognize their domain language even as they look at the code built by the software teams.

Domain-driven design’s tactical tools address a different aspect of communication issues.
