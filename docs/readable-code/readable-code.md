# Readable Code

code should be easy to understand.
your goal should be to minimize the time it takes someone else to understand your code.

Over the past five years, we have collected hundreds of examples of “bad code” (much of it
our own), and analyzed what made it bad, and what principles/techniques were used to make
it better. What we noticed is that all of the principles stem from a single theme.

Code should be easy to understand.

We believe this is the most important guiding principle you can use when deciding how to
write your code.

The Fundamental Theorem of Readability
After studying many code examples like this, we came to the conclusion that there is one metric
for readability that is more important than any other. It’s so important that we call it “The
Fundamental Theorem of Readability.”

Code should be written to minimize the time it would take for someone else to
understand it.
