# The Pragmatic Programmer Notes

Programming is a craft.  
At its simplest,  
It comes down to getting a computer to do what you want it to do (or what your user wants it to do).

As a programmer,  
You are part listener,  
Part advisor,  
Part interpreter,  
And part dictator.

You shouldnâ€™t be wedded to any particular technology,  
But have a broad enough background and experience base to allow you to choose good solutions in particular situations.

Your background stems from an understanding of the basic principles of computer science,  
And your experience comes from a wide range of practical projects.

Theory and practice combine to make you strong.
