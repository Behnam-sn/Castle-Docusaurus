## Quotes

Programming is a craft.  
At its simplest,  
It comes down to getting a computer to do what you want it to do.

As a programmer,  
You are part listener,  
Part advisor,  
Part interpreter,  
And part dictator.

You shouldn’t be wedded to any particular technology,  
But have a broad enough background and experience base to allow you to choose good solutions in particular situations.

Your background stems from an understanding of the basic principles of computer science,  
And your experience comes from a wide range of practical projects.

Theory and practice combine to make you strong.

## Take Responsibility

Responsibility is something you actively agree to.

You make a commitment to ensure that something is done right,  
But you don’t necessarily have direct control over every aspect of it.

In addition to doing your own personal best,  
You must analyze the situation for risks that are beyond your control.

You have the right not to take on a responsibility for an impossible situation,  
Or one in which the risks are too great,  
Or the ethical implications too sketchy.

You’ll have to make the call based on your own values and judgment.

When you do accept the responsibility for an outcome,  
You should expect to be held accountable for it.

When you make a mistake (as we all do) or an error in judgment,  
Admit it honestly and try to offer options.

Don’t blame someone or something else, or make up an excuse.  
Don’t blame all the problems on a vendor, a programming language, management, or your coworkers.

Any and all of these may play a role,  
But it is up to you to provide solutions, not excuses.

If there was a risk that the vendor wouldn’t come through for you,  
Then you should have had a contingency plan.

If your mass storage melts—taking all of your source code with it—and you don’t have a backup,  
It’s your fault.  
Telling your boss “the cat ate my source code’’ just won’t cut it.
