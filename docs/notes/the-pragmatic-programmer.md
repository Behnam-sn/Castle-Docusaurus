# The Pragmatic Programmer

## What is Programming?

Programming is a craft.  
At its simplest, it comes down to,  
Getting a computer to do what you want it to do,  
Or what your user wants it to do.

### Who are Programmers?

As a programmer,  
You are part listener,  
Part advisor,  
Part interpreter,  
And part dictator.

You try to capture elusive requirements,  
And find a way of expressing them,  
So that a mere machine can do them justice.

You try to document your work so that others can understand it,  
And you try to engineer your work so that others can build on it.

What’s more,  
You try to do all this against the relentless ticking of the project clock.

The work is mysterious and important.  
And you work small miracles every day.

### What is Pragmatism?

There are many people offering you help.  
Tool vendors tout the miracles their products perform.  
Methodology gurus promise that their techniques guarantee results.  
Everyone claims that their programming language is the best,  
And every operating system is the answer to all conceivable ills.

Of course, none of this is true.  
There are no easy answers.  
There is no best solution, be it a tool, a language, or an operating system.  
There can only be systems that are more appropriate in a particular set of circumstances.

This is where pragmatism comes in.  
You shouldn’t be wedded to any particular technology,  
But have a broad enough background and experience base,  
To allow you to choose good solutions in particular situations.

Your background stems from an understanding of the basic principles of computer science,
And your experience comes from a wide range of practical projects.

_Theory and practice combine to make you strong._

You adjust your approach to suit the current circumstances and environment.  
You judge the relative importance of all the factors affecting a project,  
And use your experience to produce appropriate solutions.

And you do this continuously as the work progresses.  
Pragmatic Programmers get the job done, and do it well.

## What Makes a Pragmatic Programmer?

Each developer is unique,  
With individual strengths and weaknesses,  
Preferences and dislikes.

Over time, each will craft their own personal environment.  
That environment will reflect the programmer’s individuality,  
Just as forcefully as his or her hobbies, clothing, or haircut.

However, if you’re a Pragmatic Programmer,  
You’ll share many of the following characteristics:

- Early adopter/fast adapter

  You have an instinct for technologies and techniques,  
  And you love trying things out.

  When given something new,  
  You can grasp it quickly and integrate it with the rest of your knowledge.

  Your confidence is born of experience.

- Inquisitive

  You tend to ask questions.  
  That’s neat—how did you do that?  
  Did you have problems with that library?  
  What’s this quantum computing I’ve heard about?  
  How are symbolic links implemented?

  You are a pack rat for little facts,  
  Each of which may affect some decision years from now.

- Critical thinker

  You rarely take things as given,  
  Without first getting the facts.

  When colleagues say “because that’s the way it’s done”,  
  Or a vendor promises the solution to all your problems,  
  You smell a challenge.

- Realistic

  You try to understand the underlying nature of each problem you face.

  This realism gives you a good feel for how difficult things are,  
  And how long things will take.

  Deeply understanding that a process should be difficult or will take a while to complete,  
  Gives you the stamina to keep at it.

- Jack of all trades

  You try hard to be familiar with a broad range of technologies and environments,  
  And you work to keep abreast of new developments.

  Although your current job may require you to be a specialist,  
  You will always be able to move on to new areas and new challenges.

## How to Be a Pragmatic Programmer?

In order to be a Pragmatic Programmer,  
We’re challenging you to think about what you’re doing while you’re doing it.

This isn’t a one-time audit of current practices,i
I’s an ongoing critical appraisal of every decision you make, every day, and on every project.

Never run on auto-pilot.  
Constantly be thinking,  
Critiquing your work in real time.

The old IBM corporate motto, THINK!,  
Is the Pragmatic Programmer’s mantra.

If this sounds like hard work to you,  
Then you’re exhibiting the _realistic_ characteristic.

This is going to take up some of your valuable time;
Time that is probably already under tremendous pressure.

The reward is a more active involvement with a job you love,  
A feeling of mastery over an increasing range of subjects,  
And pleasure in a feeling of continuous improvement.

Over the long term your time investment will be repaid,  
As you and your team become more efficient,  
Write code that’s easier to maintain,  
And spend less time in meetings.

## What distinguishes Pragmatic Programmers?

We feel it’s an attitude, a style, a philosophy of approaching problems and their solutions.

They think beyond the immediate problem,  
Placing it in its larger context and seeking out the bigger picture.

After all, without this larger context, how can you be pragmatic?  
How can you make intelligent compromises and informed decisions?

Another key to their success is that Pragmatic Programmers take responsibility for everything they do.  
Being responsible, Pragmatic Programmers won’t sit idly by and watch their projects fall apart through neglect.

One of the benefits of understanding the context in which you work is that it becomes easier to know just how good your software has to be.  
Sometimes near-perfection is the only option,  
But often there are trade-offs involved.

## Individual Pragmatists, Large Teams

Some people feel that there is no room for individuality on large teams or complex projects.

“Software is an engineering discipline”, they say,  
“That breaks down if individual team members make decisions for themselves”.

We strongly disagree.

There should be engineering in software construction.  
However, this doesn’t preclude individual craftsmanship.

Think about the large cathedrals built in Europe during the Middle Ages.  
Each took thousands of person-years of effort, spread over many decades.

Lessons learned were passed down to the next set of builders,  
Who advanced the state of structural engineering with their accomplishments.

But the carpenters, stonecutters, carvers, and glass workers were all craftspeople,  
Interpreting the engineering requirements to produce a whole that transcended the purely mechanical side of the construction.

It was their belief in their individual contributions that sustained the projects:  
_We who cut mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals._

Within the overall structure of a project,  
There is always room for individuality and craftsmanship.

This is particularly true given the current state of software engineering.

One hundred years from now,  
Our engineering may seem as archaic as the techniques used by medieval cathedral builders seem to today’s civil engineers,  
While our craftsmanship will still be honored.

## It’s a Continuous Process

A tourist visiting England’s Eton College asked the gardener how he got the lawns so perfect.  
“That’s easy”, he replied,  
“You just brush off the dew every morning, mow them every other day, and roll them once a week”.

“Is that all?” asked the tourist.  
“Absolutely,” replied the gardener.  
“Do that for 500 years and you’ll have a nice lawn, too”.

Great lawns need small amounts of daily care,  
And so do great programmers.

Management consultants like to drop the word kaizen in conversations.  
“Kaizen” is a Japanese term that captures the concept of continuously making many small improvements.  
It was considered to be one of the main reasons for the dramatic gains in productivity and quality in Japanese manufacturing and was widely copied throughout the world.  
Kaizen applies to individuals, too.

Every day, work to refine the skills you have and to add new tools to your repertoire.  
Unlike the Eton lawns, you’ll start seeing results in a matter of days.  
Over the years,  
You’ll be amazed at how your experience has blossomed and how your skills have grown.
