# Cores

## What is a CPU Core?

The CPU core functions as the primary processing unit of the CPU (Central Processing Unit). The component reads and executes instructions from a computer’s memory. Each core can run one task at a time, so a CPU with multiple cores can execute multiple tasks simultaneously. This is particularly beneficial for multitasking and running applications requiring high processing power.

## How Does a CPU Core Work?

Each CPU core operates independently of the others, each running at its own frequency and performing tasks as instructed by the computer’s operating system. This independent operation allows for parallel processing, where multiple tasks are processed simultaneously, significantly speeding up computing tasks and allowing for smoother multitasking.

The more cores a CPU has, the more tasks it can handle at once, which can greatly enhance the performance of software designed to take advantage of multi-core CPUs.

## Benefits of Multi-core Processor

Multi-core processors have revolutionized computing, offering several benefits over single-core processors. Multi-core processors are particularly beneficial for software that can utilise multiple cores, such as video editing programs, 3D rendering software, and modern video games.

Multi-core processors allow for the following:

Enhanced multitasking: With multiple cores, your computer can handle several tasks without slowing down.
Improved performance: More cores mean more processing power, leading to faster and smoother performance, especially for demanding applications.
Energy efficiency: Multi-core processors can often do more work with less power, making them more energy-efficient than single-core processors.

A single-core processor was standard in the past,  
All CPUs have multiple physical cores today.

A core is an individual processing unit within a CPU.

More cores allow the CPU to handle multiple threads (sequences of instructions) in parallel,  
Significantly improving overall performance.

Applications can take advantage of the multi-core design,  
By dividing tasks into smaller subtasks that can be completed simultaneously.

## The Solution Provided by Multi-Core Processors

Multi-core processors have provided a solution to the limitations of single-core processors. In other words – by allowing multiple threads to run on each core, multi-core processors can significantly boost a computer’s performance. They are particularly beneficial for running applications requiring high processing power, such as video editing software, 3D rendering applications, and modern video games.

## Difference between CPU Cores and Threads

While CPU cores and threads are closely related, they serve different functions in a computer’s architecture. A core is a physical component of the CPU that can execute instructions, while a thread is a virtual sequence of instructions that can be executed by a core.

Cores can be visualized as the workers, while threads are the tasks they perform. Combining multi-core processors and multithreading techniques has revolutionized computing, enabling computers to perform more tasks faster and more efficiently.
