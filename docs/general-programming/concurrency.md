# Concurrency

## What is Concurrency?

Concurrency is doing more than one thing at a time.

## What Problem Concurrency is Trying to Solve?

Processor clock speeds are no longer increasing.  
Instead, we’re getting more cores with each new generation of CPUs.

In order to get a computation to run faster,  
We’ll have to split up a computation into concurrent pieces,  
Witch can be processed on multiple cores and threads.

## How to Use Concurrency?

Concurrency in programming is when multiple sequences of operations are run in overlapping periods of time.

There are a few ways to program concurrency:

- ### Asynchronous Programming

  A form of a non-blocking architecture,  
  Which means it doesn’t block further execution,  
  While one or more operations are in progress.

- ### Multi-Threading

  A form of concurrency that uses multiple threads.
