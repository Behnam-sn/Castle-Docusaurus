# Engineering Notes

## What

Engineering is the practice of using natural science, mathematics, and the engineering design process,  
To solve problems within technology,  
Increase efficiency and productivity, and improve systems.

Modern engineering comprises many subfields which include designing and improving infrastructure, machinery, vehicles, electronics, materials, and energy systems.

The discipline of engineering encompasses a broad range of more specialized fields of engineering,  
Each with a more specific emphasis for applications of mathematics and science.

## Definition

The American Engineers' Council for Professional Development has defined "engineering" as:

The creative application of scientific principles to design or develop  
Structures, machines, apparatus,  
Or manufacturing processes,  
Or works utilizing them singly or in combination;

Or to construct or operate the same with full cognizance of their design;  
Or to forecast their behavior under specific operating conditions;  
All as respects an intended function, economics of operation and safety to life and property.
