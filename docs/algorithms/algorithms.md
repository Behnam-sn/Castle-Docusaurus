# Algorithms

## What is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is a set of instructions for accomplishing a task.  
Every piece of code could be called an algorithm.

## Running Time

## Binary Search

## the main takeaways are as follows

- Algorithm speed isn’t measured in seconds, but in growth of the number of operations.
- Instead, we talk about how quickly the run time of an algorithm increases as the size of the input increases.
- Run time of algorithms is expressed in Big O notation.
- O(log n) is faster than O(n), but it gets a lot faster as the list of items you’re searching grows.

Recap

- Binary search is a lot faster than simple search.
- O(log n) is faster than O(n), but it gets a lot faster once the list of items you’re searching through grows.
- Algorithm speed isn’t measured in seconds.
- Algorithm times are measured in terms of growth of an algorithm.
- Algorithm times are written in Big O notation.

There are two different types of access: random access and sequential access.
