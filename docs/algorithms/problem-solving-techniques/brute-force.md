# Brute Force

## What is Brute Force?

Brute Force Algorithms are straightforward approach of solving a problem,  
That rely on sheer computing power,  
And trying every possibility rather than advanced techniques to improve efficiency.

:::note
Brute force is a generic method and not limited to any specific domain of problems.

## When to Use Brute Force?

Brute force algorithms are slow.  
Brute force is employed when the issue is small enough to make an in-depth investigation possible.

However, because of their high temporal complexity,  
Brute force techniques are inefficient for large-scale issues.

The method is also used when the simplicity of implementation is more important than processing speed.

## How to Use Use Brute Force?

Brute force algorithms investigate every potential solution to an issue,  
Usually in an organized and detailed way.

This involves attempting each option in a specified order.

:::note
The brute force approach is guaranteed to find the correct solution,  
By listing all the possible candidate solutions for the problem.
