# Brute Force

## What is the Brute Force Algorithm?

A brute force algorithm is a simple,  
Comprehensive search strategy,  
That systematically explores every option until a problem’s answer is discovered.

It’s a generic approach to problem-solving,  
That’s employed when the issue is small enough to make an in-depth investigation possible.

However, because of their high temporal complexity,  
Brute force techniques are inefficient for large-scale issues.

Brute force algorithms investigate every potential solution to an issue,  
Usually in an organized and detailed way.

This involves attempting each option in a specified order.

The brute force approach is a guaranteed way to find the correct solution by listing all the possible candidate solutions for the problem.

It is a generic method and not limited to any specific domain of problems.

Brute force algorithms are slow.

Brute Force Algorithms are straightforward methods of solving a problem that rely on sheer computing power and trying every possibility rather than advanced techniques to improve efficiency.
