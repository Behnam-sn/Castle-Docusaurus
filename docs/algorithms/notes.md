Algorithms:
Simple Search
Binary Search

Hash functions
They’re also known as hash maps, maps, dictionaries, and associative arrays.
hashes are good for:
• Modeling relationships from one thing to another thing
• Filtering out duplicates
• Caching/memoizing data instead of making your server do work

Math:
Algoghabra
factorial

Concepts:
Recursion
Divide and Conquer

Euclid’s algorithm

Functional Programming

pseudocode
Pseudocode is a high-level description in code of the problem you’re trying to solve.
It’s written like code, but it’s meant to be closer to human speech.

Recursion is used when it makes the solution clearer.
There’s no performance benefit to using recursion; in fact, loops are
sometimes better for performance.
