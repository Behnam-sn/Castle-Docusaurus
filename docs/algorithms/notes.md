# Notes

## Algorithms Task

- Write Binary Search in C#
- Write Simple Search in C#
- Write Breadth-First Search in C#
- Write Depth-First Search in C#

## Algorithms

- Simple Search
- Binary Search
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Breadth-First Search  
  Breadth-first search is a traversal algorithm.  
  That means it is an algorithm that visits every node in a tree—that is, it traverses or walks the tree.
- Depth-First Search

## Data Structures

- Array
- linked List
- Stack  
  Last In First Out  
  Push & Pop
- Queue  
  First In First Out  
  Enqueue & Dequeue
- Set
- Hash Tables
  - Hash functions
  - They’re also known as hash maps, maps, dictionaries, and associative arrays.
  - hashes are good for:
  - Modeling relationships from one thing to another thing
  - Filtering out duplicates
  - Caching/memoizing data instead of making your server do work
- Graphs
- Tree
  Trees are a subset of graphs.
  A tree is a special type of graph where no edges ever point back.
  Nodes can have children, and child nodes can have a parent.
  In a tree, nodes have at most one parent.
  The only node with no parents is the root.
  Nodes with no children are called leaf nodes.
  trees don’t have cycles.
  A tree is a connected, acyclic graph.
  Rooted trees have one node that leads to all the other nodes.

## Math

- Algebra
- Factorial

## Concepts

- Recursion
  Recursion is used when it makes the solution clearer.  
  There’s no performance benefit to using recursion; in fact, loops are sometimes better for performance.
- Divide and Conquer
- Functional Programming
- Cryptography
  - Euclid’s algorithm
- Pseudo Code
  Pseudo Code is a high-level description in code of the problem you’re trying to solve.
  It’s written like code, but it’s meant to be closer to human speech.
- compression algorithm
- Huffman coding
- topological sort
