# Predictive and Adaptive Planning

## Predictive Planning

One reason that the waterfall endures is the desire for predictability in software development.  
Nothing is more frustrating than not having a clear idea how much lt will cost to build some software and how long it will take to build it.

A predictive approach looks to do work early in the project in order to yield a greater understanding of what has to be done later.  
This way, you can reach a point where the latter part of the project can be estimated with a reasonable degree of accuracy.

With **predictive planning**, a project has two stages.  
The first stage comes up with plans and is difficult to predict,  
But the second stage is much more predictable because the plans are in place.

This isn't necessarily a black-and-white affair.  
As the project goes on, you gradually get more predictability.

And even once you have a predictive plan, things will go wrong.  
You simply expect that the deviations become less significant once a solid plan is in place.

However, there is a considerable debate about whether many software projects can ever be predictable.

At the heart of this question is requirements analysis.  
One of the unique sources of complexity in software projects is the difficulty in understanding the requirements for a software system.

The majority of software projects experience significant **requirements churn**:  
changes in requirements in the later stages of the project.

These changes shatter the foundations of a predictive plan.  
You can combat these changes by freezing the requirements early an and not permitting changes,  
But this runs the risk of delivering a system that no longer meets the needs of its users.

This problem leads to two very different reactions.

One route is to put more effort into the requirements process itself.  
This way, you may get a more accurate set of requirements, which will reduce the churn.

Another school contends that requirements churn is unavoidable,  
That it's too difficult for many projects to stabilize requirements sufficiently to use a predictive plan.

This may be either owing to the sheer difficulty of envisioning what software can do or because market conditions force unpredictable changes.  
This school of thought advocates **adaptive planning**,  
Whereby predictivity is seen as an illusion.  
Instead of fooling ourselves with illusory predictability,  
We should face the reality of constant change and use a planning approach that treats change as a constant in a software project.  
This change is controlled so that the project delivers the best software it can;  
But although the project is controllable, it is not predictable.

he difference between a predictive project and an adaptive project surfaces in many ways that people talk about how the project goes.  
When people talk about a project that's doing well because it's going according to plan,  
That's a predictive form of thinking.  
You can't say "according to plan" in an adaptive environment,  
Because the plan is always changing.

This doesn't mean that adaptive projects don't plan;  
They usually plan a lot,  
But the plan is treated as a baseline to assess the consequences of change rather than as a prediction of the future.

With a predictive plan, you can develop a fixed-price/fixed-scope contract.  
Such a contract says exactly what should be built, how much it will cost, and when it will be delivered.

Such fixing isn't possible with an adaptive plan .  
You can fix a budget and a time for delivery,  
But you can't fix what functionality will be delivered.

An adaptive contract assumes that the users will collaborate with the development team to regularly reassess what functionality needs to be built
and will cancel the project if progress ends up being too slow.  
As such, an adaptive planning process can be fixed price/variable scope.

Naturally, the adaptive approach is less desirable,  
As anyone would prefer greater predictability in a software project.

However, predictability depends an a precise, accurate, and stable set of requirements.
If you cannot stabilize your requirements,  
The predictive plan is based an sand and the chances are high that the project goes off course.

This leads to two important pieces of advice:

1. Don't make a predictive plan until you have precise and accurate requirements and are confident that they won't significantly change.
1. If you can't get precise, accurate, and stable requirements, use an adaptive planning style.

Predictivity and adaptivity feed into the choice of life cycle.

An adaptive plan absolutely requires an iterative process.

Predictive planning can be done either way,  
Although it's easier to see how it works with waterfall or a staged delivery approach.
