# Memory

Memory is an allocation of computer files,  
From which specific operating instructions,  
Or other forms of digital information,  
Can be extracted and utilized.

Memory usually takes the form of short-term storage for the files most often accessed during recent computer use.

When a piece of data first enters an operating system (OS),  
It’s placed within that OS’s random-access memory (RAM).
