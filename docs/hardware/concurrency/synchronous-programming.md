# Synchronous Programming

## What is Synchronous Programming?

Synchronous is known as a blocking architecture.

Synchronous programs follows a strict set of sequences,  
Which means that operations are performed one at a time,
In perfect order.

## Why Use Synchronous Programming?

Some of the benefits of synchronous programming:

- ### Predictable Results

  Synchronous programs run in a predictable, linear fashion.

- ### Less Memory Usage

  Since synchronous programs only execute one task at a time,  
  There isn’t a need for storing the state of multiple tasks.

  This means that fewer resources are needed, and less memory is used.

- ### Easier to Understand

  Synchronous programs are easier to debug,  
  Because there is often only one path for the code to follow,  
  As tasks can only be completed in a specific order.

  That way, you won’t complicate things too much.

## How Synchronous Programming works?

While one operation is being performed,  
Other operations’ instructions are blocked.

The completion of the first task triggers the next, and so on.
