# Cores

A single-core processor was standard in the past,  
All CPUs have multiple physical cores today.

A core is an individual processing unit within a CPU.

More cores allow the CPU to handle multiple threads (sequences of instructions) in parallel,  
Significantly improving overall performance.

Applications can take advantage of the multi-core design,  
By dividing tasks into smaller subtasks that can be completed simultaneously.
