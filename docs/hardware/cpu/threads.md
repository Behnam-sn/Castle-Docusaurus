# Threads

## What are threads?

Threads can be thought of as virtual sequences of instructions that are issued to a CPU. Primarily, theyâ€™re a way to divide workloads and share those responsibilities among different processors.

Two related terms are multithreading and hyper-threading. In the former, tasks are split into distinct threads and run in parallel. Hyper-threading helps achieve even greater performance benefits because processors are used to carry out two threads at the same time.
