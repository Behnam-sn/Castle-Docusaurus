# Hyper-Threading

Hyper-threading is a simultaneous multithreading implementation developed by Intel,  
That allows each CPU core to run multiple threads simultaneously.

It allows each physical core to appear as two virtual cores in the operating system.  
The software uses available hardware resources more efficiently.
