# Data storage

Data storage refers to the act of retaining information,  
So it can be easily accessed later, or even kept permanently.

Computers rely upon two types of storage,  
Classified as either primary storage or secondary storage.

Primary storage (which is also known as main memory, or just “the main”) contains operating instructions or data retrieval.  
The CPU routinely engages with the primary storage to get access to such data.
