# Good-Enough Software

> Striving to better, oft we mar what’s well.
> Shakespeare, King Lear 1.4

There’s an old(ish) joke about a company that places an order for 100,000 ICs with a Japanese manufacturer.

Part of the specification was the defect rate:  
One chip in 10,000.

A few weeks later the order arrived:  
One large box containing thousands of ICs,  
And a small one containing just ten.

Attached to the small box was a label that read:  
_These are the faulty ones._

If only we really had this kind of control over quality.  
But the real world just won’t let us produce much that’s truly perfect,  
Particularly not bug-free software.

Time, technology, and temperament all conspire against us.

However, this doesn’t have to be frustrating.

As Ed Yourdon described in an article in IEEE Software,  
Named when good-enough software is best,  
You can discipline yourself to write software that’s good enough,  
Good enough for your users, for future maintainers, for your own peace of mind.

You’ll find that you are more productive and your users are happier.

And you may well find that your programs are actually better for their shorter incubation.
