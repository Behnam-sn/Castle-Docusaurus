# Waterfall

## What is Waterfall Software Development Process?

The **waterfall** style breaks down a project based an activity.

To build Software, you have to do certain activities:  
Requirements analysis, design, coding, and testing.

Our 1-year project might have:  
A 2 month analysis phase,  
Followed by a 4 month design phase,  
Followed by a 3 month coding phase,  
Followed by a 3 month testing phase.

## Backflows

With waterfall development,  
There is usually some form of formal handoff between each phase,  
But there are often backflows.

During coding, something may come up that causes you to revisit the analysis and design.  
You certainly should not assume that all design is finished when coding begins.

It's inevitable that analysis and design decisions will have to be revisited in later phases.  
However, these backflows are exceptions and should be minimized as much as possible.

Most software developers especially in the object-oriented community dislike the waterfall approach.

Of the many reasons for this,  
The most fundamental is that it's very difficult to tell whether the project is truly an track with a waterfall process.  
It's too easy to declare victory with early phases and hide a schedule slip.

Usually the only way you can really tell whether you are an track is to produce tested, integrated software.  
By doing this repeatedly, an iterative style gives you better warning if something is going wrong.

For that reason alone,  
It's strongly recommend that projects do not use a pure waterfall approach.  
You should at least use staged delivery, if not a more pure iterative technique.
