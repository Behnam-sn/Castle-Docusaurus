# BDD

Behavior Driven Development

## What is BDD?

BDD is an Agile software development methodology.

BDD creates a shared understanding of how an application should be documented and designed around the expected behavior from a user when interacting with it.

## What is the Difference Between BDD and TDD?

There are a lots of similarities between BDD and TDD
as they are both a testing method
that requires developers to write the tests
prior to writing the code to pass the tests.

TDD at its core is more focused on separately testing smaller pieces of functionality,
whereas BDD is designed to test an application’s behavior from the end user’s perspective.

BDD is TDD done right!

## What are the benefits of BDD?

- **Collaboration**  
  BDD allows for continued collaboration and increased visibility among the entire team,
  By creating concrete examples of the expected system behavior,
  and being detailed enough for developers and testers,
  while still making sense to business participants.

- **User Satisfaction**  
  By focusing on the needs of the business, you get satisfied users.

- **Focus on Business Objectives**  
  All development work can be traced back directly to business objectives.

- **Fewer Bugs**  
  Involving testers from the beginning means fewer bugs later.

- **Effectiveness**  
  Since you extend the system in small increments,
  you can validate business values earlier and avoid unnecessary features.

- **Faster Feedback**  
  Example scenarios makes small-scale changes to the system under development.
  This enables teams to evolve the system in small steps
  while keeping it potentially shippable, allowing for shorter release cycles and faster feedback.

- **Code Quality**  
  BDD has a positive impact on code quality,
  it promotes a design that ensures loosely-coupled,
  highly cohesive architecture and avoids over-engineering.

## How to use BDD?

### 3 phases of BDD

1. #### Discover

   Discovery refers to
   a structured, collaborative session for
   specifying software requirements with examples.

1. #### Formulate

   Formulation is the practice of turning key examples  
   from Discovery into formalized documentation,  
   such as the human readable Gherkin scenarios.

   You can learn about Gherkin in this page.

1. #### Automate

   Automation is where formalized scenarios are turned into automated acceptance tests.  
   automated acceptance tests provide immediate feedback  
   when the specification documentation  
   doesn’t match the system behavior anymore.

   You can learn about acceptance testing in this page.
