# SpecFlow

## What Is SpecFlow?

SpecFlow is a test automation solution for .NET,
built upon the BDD paradigm.

You can use SpecFlow to  
define, manage and automatically execute  
human-readable acceptance tests in .NET projects.

SpecFlow tests are written using Gherkin,  
which allows you to write test cases using natural languages.

SpecFlow uses the official Gherkin parser,  
which supports over 70 languages.

These tests are then tied to your application code using so-called bindings,  
allowing you to execute the tests using the testing framework of your choice.
