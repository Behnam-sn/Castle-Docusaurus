# Gherkin

## What Is Gherkin?

Gherkin is the beating heart of BDD,  
Gherkin makes test scenarios easy to read.

With Gherkin,  
you can use your native language to describe test cases  
instead of difficult to read and understand camel case test method names.

## How to use Gherkin Syntax?

Gherkin-syntax is designed to be  
a non-technical and human-readable way of  
describing use cases in software.

Gherkin syntax has a few keywords that indicate a special behavior:

- Feature
- Feature Description
- Scenario
- Scenario Description
- Given
- And
- When
- Then
- Tags
